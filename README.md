# TabLayoutDemo_part_2

This project is part of a two-part series articles which demonstrates some features when using TabLayout component. It shows how to add and remove tabs dynamically and also how to handle orientation change in order to keep all current tabs, including those ones user might have added dynamically and skipping those tabs user has deleted.

You will find two different approaches to handle orientation change. In order to use one or another you just need to change a flag inside the code.
